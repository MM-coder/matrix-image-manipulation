### Building from source

These instructions are OS-agnostic, for OS-specific queries please refer to the Go documentation

If not installed, download [Go](https://go.dev/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/), open a terminal window and run the following commands in the directory you would like to download the project to and run the following in order.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MM-coder/matrix-image-manipulation.git
cd matrix-image-manipulation
go build
```
This will create the `matrix-image-manipulation` executable, in this case a `.exe`, to run it, call it in your terminal

```bash
.\matrix-image-manipulation.exe
```

This will bring up the CLI.
